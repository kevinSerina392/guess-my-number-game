This is a simple game called Guess My Number.

Here is a screenshot of what the game looks like.

Here the user will enter a value from 1-20 to guess the hidden value of the number. 
The number will be random and will inform the user if the value they entered is
either "Too Low" or "Too High". When the player guesses the correct answer,
the game will say "You Win!" and save the highscore.
